I wrote this book because I thought it was important to understand where Bitcoin camer from. 
There are many teams out there that believe that their token is the real Bitcoin, those who claim
to be true to the vision that Satoshi set out in his Bitcoin Whitepaper. In order to understand where 
we are right now in the state of the cryptocurrency world, I think its just as important to understand
the whys and hows. 

Its not just Satoshi who is responsible for Bitcoin, many came along and have since continued 
on with the project since his last messages and helped continue to grow the project. 

This is just an attempt to keep a record of all the things that Satoshi put out there for us. 

This book is free, but if you'd like to say thanks, or have a nice printed edition of it - you 
can buy it on Amazon.
